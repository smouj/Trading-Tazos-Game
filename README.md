**Aim. Throw. Flip. Capture. Collect.**

Trading Tazos Game is a browser-based digital tazo (pog) battle game designed entirely with a 90s gaming magazine aesthetic — cream paper backgrounds, yellow mastheads, halftone dot patterns, bold comic typography, and 3px black border cards with drop shadows. You don't just compare stats — you aim, charge power, and throw tazos into a 3D physics-simulated arena. Features 319 tazos across 3 collections (Minimon, Dracobell, Cybermon), 9 combat stats, a unified 3D physics battle engine with AI opponents, real potato chip bag opening with 3D textures, and a full progression system with quests and achievements.

## What Makes It Different

Trading Tazos Game is **not** an auto-battle card game.
It's a game of **physical tazo throwing** — aim, power, physics, chain rebounds, risk, and field control.

### Core Game Loop

1. **Select** a tazo from your active deck
2. **Aim** horizontally and vertically with timing-based precision
3. **Charge** power — more impact, less accuracy
4. **Throw** into the 3D physics arena
5. **Impact** enemy tazos — flip to capture, push them out, or chain rebounds
6. **Risk it**: miss and your tazo stays vulnerable. Throw too hard and it flies out — the rival places it anywhere.

## Collections

| # | Collection | Origin | Tazos |
|:--:|-----------|--------|:-----:|
| 1 | **Minimon** — inspired by Pokémon Tazos 1 (Matutano, 2000) | Spain | 51 |
| 2 | **Dracobell** — inspired by Dragon Ball Z (Matutano, 1995) | Spain | 118 |
| 3 | **Cybermon** — inspired by Digimon Magic Box (2000) | Spain | 150 |
| | | **Total** | **319** |

All 319 tazos verified against original Spanish physical collections. Each tazo has 9 balanced combat stats, a tactical role, and evolutive relationships (pre-evolution, evolution, transformation stage). Names have been minimally tweaked to avoid IP conflicts while staying instantly recognizable.

---

## Combat Stats

| Stat | Icon | Description |
|------|:----:|-------------|
| Attack | ATK | Impact power — how hard it hits opponents |
| Defense | DEF | Flipping resistance — stay upright on impact |
| Resistance | RES | Difficulty to be flipped or pushed |
| Weight | WGT | Physical mass — affects damage, push force, and stability |
| Stability | STB | Prevents self-flips, knockbacks, and out-of-bounds |
| Spin | SPN | Maintains rotation and energy after landing |
| Control | CTR | Reduces throw deviation for better accuracy |
| Bounce | BNC | Improves rebounds and chained multi-hits |
| Precision | PRC | Improves aim and reduces horizontal/vertical error |

### Throw Risk / Reward

| Power Level | Circle Size | Impact | Accuracy | Risk |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|:--------:|------|
| Low | Large | Weak | High | Safe — stays in bounds |
| Medium | Medium | Balanced | Normal | Standard risk |
| High | Small | Strong | Low | May scatter unpredictably |
| Maximum | Tiny | Devastating | Very Low | High chance of self-flip or flying out |

git clone https://github.com/smouj/Trading-Tazos-Game.git
cd Trading-Tazos-Game

bun install                              # Dependencies
cp .env.example .env                     # Set your JWT_SECRET

```

---

## Deployment

The live app runs at **[medaclawarena.com](https://medaclawarena.com)** using PM2 + Caddy on a VPS. See [`deploy.example.sh`](./deploy.example.sh) for the annotated deploy pipeline and [`Caddyfile.example`](./Caddyfile.example) for the reverse-proxy configuration.

### Production Architecture

```
medaclawarena.com
  └── Caddy (TLS 1.3, gzip, CSP, HSTS, WebSocket upgrade)
      ├── PM2 `ttg`     (fork, :3000) — Next.js standalone server
      └── PM2 `ttg-ws`  (fork, :3001) — WebSocket battle server
```

## i18n — 10 Languages

Detects language from `navigator.languages` / `Accept-Language` header, persists in `localStorage`.

| Code | Language    | Coverage |
|:----:|-------------|:--------:|
|  EN  | English     | 100%     |
|  ES  | Spanish     | 100%     |
|  PT  | Portuguese  | 100%     |
|  DE  | German      | 100%     |
|  FR  | French      | 100%     |
|  IT  | Italian     | 100%     |
|  JA  | Japanese    | 100%     |
|  KO  | Korean      | 100%     |
|  ZH  | Chinese     | 100%     |
|  RU  | Russian     | 100%     |

---

## Design System

The game uses a **90s Nintendo Power / Pokémon Magazine** aesthetic specified in [`THEME.md`](./THEME.md). Every visual element follows a documented design system:

- 12-token color palette (`#FFCC00` yellow, `#E3350D` red, `#3B4CCA` blue, ...)
- 7-level typography hierarchy (all `font-black` + `uppercase`)
- 4-level border + shadow system on `#1a1a1a`
- 30+ documented CSS utility classes (`mag-card`, `mag-btn`, `mag-stroke`, `mag-bg`, ...)
- Component anatomy diagrams for cards, buttons, page shells
- 15 anti-pattern rules (no emojis, no grays, no `rounded-xl`, no default Tailwind shadows)

---

## Desktop App

Desktop installers for all platforms are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/smouj/Trading-Tazos-Game/releases/latest).

| Platform | Format | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Linux | AppImage, .deb | ✅ Available |
| Windows | .exe (NSIS) | ✅ Available |
| macOS | .dmg, .zip | ✅ Available |

---

## CLI (Planned)

A terminal interface for searching, inspecting, and simulating battles with tazos:

```bash
tazos search minimon     # Search the tazo database
tazos info 25            # Full stats breakdown
tazos stats              # Collection statistics
tazos top --stat attack  # Leaderboard by any stat
tazos battle --seed 42   # Simulate a physics battle
```

📦 CLI repo: [github.com/smouj/trading-tazos-game-cli](https://github.com/smouj/trading-tazos-game-cli) (development)

## Disclaimer

**This is an original game built on verified physical collection data.** Tazo names have been minimally tweaked to avoid intellectual property conflicts with the franchises that inspired the original physical tazos (Pokémon, Dragon Ball, Digimon). No copyrighted images, audio, or brand assets are included — all tazo visuals are original generated SVGs. The game's engine, design, styling, and codebase are original work.
