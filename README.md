**Aim. Throw. Flip. Capture. Collect.**

Trading Tazos Game is a browser-based physical tazo (pog) battle game. You don't just compare stats — you physically aim, charge power, and throw tazos into a physics-simulated arena. Built with a 90s Nintendo Power magazine aesthetic, 319 tazos across 3 collections (Minimon, Dracobell, Cybermon), 9 combat stats, 8 roles, a deterministic battle engine, WebSocket PvP multiplayer, and a full progression system.

## What Makes It Different

Trading Tazos Game is **not** an auto-battle card game.
It's a game of **physical tazo throwing** — aim, power, physics, chain rebounds, risk, and field control.

### Core Game Loop

1. **Select** a tazo from your active deck
2. **Aim** horizontally and vertically with timing-based precision
3. **Charge** power — more impact, less accuracy
4. **Throw** into the 2D physics arena
5. **Impact** enemy tazos — flip to capture, push them out, or chain rebounds
6. **Risk it**: miss and your tazo stays vulnerable. Throw too hard and it flies out — the rival places it anywhere.

## Collections

| # | Collection | Origin | Tazos |
|:--:|-----------|--------|:-----:|
| 1 | **Minimon** — inspired by Pokémon Tazos 1 (Matutano, 2000) | Spain | 51 |
| 2 | **Dracobell** — inspired by Dragon Ball Z (Matutano, 1995) | Spain | 118 |
| 3 | **Cybermon** — inspired by Digimon Magic Box (2000) | Spain | 150 |
| | | **Total** | **319** |

All 319 tazos verified against original Spanish physical collections. Each tazo has 9 balanced combat stats, a tactical role, and evolutive relationships (pre-evolution, evolution, transformation stage). Names have been minimally tweaked to avoid IP conflicts while staying instantly recognizable.

---

## Combat Stats

| Stat | Icon | Description |
|------|:----:|-------------|
| Attack | ATK | Impact power — how hard it hits opponents |
| Defense | DEF | Flipping resistance — stay upright on impact |
| Resistance | RES | Difficulty to be flipped or pushed |
| Weight | WGT | Physical mass — affects damage, push force, and stability |
| Stability | STB | Prevents self-flips, knockbacks, and out-of-bounds |
| Spin | SPN | Maintains rotation and energy after landing |
| Control | CTR | Reduces throw deviation for better accuracy |
| Bounce | BNC | Improves rebounds and chained multi-hits |
| Precision | PRC | Improves aim and reduces horizontal/vertical error |

### Throw Risk / Reward

| Power Level | Circle Size | Impact | Accuracy | Risk |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|:--------:|------|
| Low | Large | Weak | High | Safe — stays in bounds |
| Medium | Medium | Balanced | Normal | Standard risk |
| High | Small | Strong | Low | May scatter unpredictably |
| Maximum | Tiny | Devastating | Very Low | High chance of self-flip or flying out |

## Design System

The game uses a **90s Nintendo Power / Pokémon Magazine** aesthetic specified in [`THEME.md`](./THEME.md). Every visual element follows a documented design system:

- 12-token color palette (`#FFCC00` yellow, `#E3350D` red, `#3B4CCA` blue, ...)
- 7-level typography hierarchy (all `font-black` + `uppercase`)
- 4-level border + shadow system on `#1a1a1a`
- 30+ documented CSS utility classes (`mag-card`, `mag-btn`, `mag-stroke`, `mag-bg`, ...)
- Component anatomy diagrams for cards, buttons, page shells
- 15 anti-pattern rules (no emojis, no grays, no `rounded-xl`, no default Tailwind shadows)

---
