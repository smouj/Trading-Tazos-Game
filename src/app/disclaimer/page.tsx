          <p>
            Trading Tazos Game is a fan-made digital collectible experience. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
            or connected to any tazo manufacturer, snack brand, or original series. Minimon, Dracobell, and Cybermon
            are completely original fictional IPs created for this game. Any resemblance to existing series is coincidental.
          </p>

          <p>
            The service is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without any warranty, express or implied.
            We do not guarantee that the service will be error-free, uninterrupted, or secure.

          <p>
            All items in TTG — tazos, credits, bags, and collectibles — are virtual and have no real-world monetary value.
            They cannot be exchanged for real currency, goods, or services. Purchases of virtual currency are final
            and non-refundable except as required by applicable law.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-black uppercase text-[#1a1a1a] mt-6">4. Scanner Feature</h2>
          <p>
            The scanner feature is provided for entertainment purposes. Image recognition results are not guaranteed
            to be accurate or complete. Do not rely on the scanner for authentication or valuation of physical items.
            By using the scanner, you confirm you have the right to upload the images you submit.
