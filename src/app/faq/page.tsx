    q: "What is Trading Tazos Game?",
    a: "Trading Tazos Game is a browser-based skill game where you collect, trade, and battle with digital tazos. Album, shop, deck, and scanner views stay clear and readable in 2D; matches use a 3D arena where you aim, charge power, and throw your tazos. 319 verified tazos from 3 classic Spanish collections, with 9 combat stats each."
  },
  {
    q: "Is it free to play?",
    a: "Yes, completely free. Credits are earned by battling, completing quests, and daily logins, then used to open tazo bags and grow your collection."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get started?",
    a: "1. Create a free account. 2. You'll receive 10 free potato chip bags with surprise tazos inside — open them in the Shop. 3. Head to the Battle Arena and start playing, or open tazo bags in the Shop to expand your collection."
  },
  {
    q: "How does the battle system work?",
    a: "Each turn you select a tazo, aim horizontally and vertically with timing-based precision, charge power, and throw. The tazo enters a 3D battle arena where it can collide with and flip rival tazos. Flip all rival tazos to win. Strategy matters — overpowering can cause self-flips or out-of-bounds throws."
  },
  {
    q: "What are tazo stats and roles?",
    a: "Each tazo has 9 combat stats (Attack, Defense, Resistance, Weight, Stability, Spin, Control, Bounce, Precision) and 1 of 8 roles (Attacker, Tank, Technical, Bouncer, Heavy, Light, Balanced, Special). Stats and roles determine performance in battle."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I play on mobile?",
    a: "Yes! Trading Tazos Game is a PWA (Progressive Web App). Visit medaclawarena.com on your phone and install it to your home screen for a full-screen app experience. Desktop users can also download native apps for Linux, Windows, and macOS."
  },
  {
    q: "What are credits and how do I earn them?",
    a: "Credits are the in-game currency used to open tazo bags in the Shop. Earn credits by winning battles (+30), logging in daily (+25), and completing quests (+50-200)."
  },
  {
    q: "How do quests and achievements work?",
    a: "The quest system has 17 quests across 4 categories: Beginner, Daily, Weekly, and Special. Complete quests to earn credits. The achievement system has 18 achievements with 4 tiers (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum)."
  },
  {
    q: "What are the collections?",
    a: "Three collections of verified Spanish tazos: Minimon (51 tazos, Matutano 2000), Dracobell (118 tazos, Matutano 1995, 7 categories), and Cybermon (150 tazos, Magic Box 2000). 319 tazos total."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I play against friends?",
    a: "PvP uses WebSocket matchmaking and is being kept behind account and deck requirements while the live service is tested. Both players need an account and an active battle deck of 5 tazos."
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a desktop app?",
    a: "Yes, native Electron desktop apps are available for Linux (.AppImage and .deb), Windows (.exe), and macOS (.dmg for Intel and Apple Silicon). Download from the Downloads page or GitHub Releases."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the CLI tool?",
