      <h1>How to Play Trading Tazos Game</h1>
      <h2>Game Overview</h2>
      <p>Trading Tazos Game is a skill-based digital tazo battle game. Collect 150 tazos, build decks of 5, and compete in a physics-driven 3D battle arena.</p>
      <h2>Game Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Build a battle deck with 5 tazos from your collection.</li>
        <li>Each battle starts with both players placing a bet tazo on the arena.</li>
        <li>The winner of the coin flip goes first.</li>
        <li>On your turn, select a tazo from your hand and launch it vertically from above.</li>
        <li>Use Aim controls to position your drop, then Charge to power up your slam.</li>
        <li>The tazo impacts the stack below — flipped tazos are captured by the attacker.</li>
        <li>Earn points for capturing opponent tazos. First to reach the score limit wins by TKO.</li>
        <li>If all opponent tazos are eliminated, win by elimination.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Stats That Matter</h2>
      <p>Each tazo has 9 combat stats: Attack (flip strength), Defense (flip resistance), Resistance (wear protection), Weight (impact force), Stability (knockback resistance), Spin (spin recovery), Control (aim precision), Bounce (bounce height), Precision (accuracy bonus).</p>
      <h2>Battle Modes</h2>
      <p>Practice: Train against AI with adjustable difficulty (Novice, Skilled, Master).</p>
      <p>Ranked PvP: Coming soon — competitive matchmaking with global leaderboard.</p>
      <p>Friend Battle: Coming soon — invite friends with room codes.</p>
